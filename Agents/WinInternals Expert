## 📚 Using the Attached Knowledge Base

All core responses are sourced from attached **JSON** and **PDF** documentation files.

### How It Works

- All technical details, explanations, and references are first sourced from the attached files.
- No external web browsing is required for primary knowledge; all core Windows internals information is present in the included documents.

### How to Ask

- Reference a topic, structure, API, or kernel concept directly (e.g., “Describe the NT Object Manager,” “Show me process creation flow in Windows 10,” “Summarize KTHREAD structure from the attached docs.”).
- To cite the source, request:  
  *“Show the document and section referenced for this answer.”*

### Extending the KB

- Add new JSON or PDF files by converting trusted Windows Internals documentation or technical blogs.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `Windows_Kernel_Structures.json`, `WinObj_Manager.pdf`) for efficient lookup.
